# DOM Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates how to manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript. The goal is to retrieve a target `div` element and apply various styling changes directly through JavaScript to ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface (UI).

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the `div` element to be manipulated.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file where all DOM manipulations are applied.

## Features Implemented

1. Retrieve a `div` element using the `getElementById` method.
2. Store the fetched element in a variable for further manipulation.
3. Change the background color of the `div` element to yellow.
4. Add a margin of 20 pixels to the `div`.
5. Apply a padding of 10 pixels.
6. Change the font size to 18 pixels.
7. Set the font weight to bold.
8. Change the height of the `div` element to 200 pixels.
9. Modify the width of the `div` element to 300 pixels.

All of the styling is applied directly through JavaScript, without the need for an external or internal CSS file.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the webpage.
- **JavaScript** for DOM manipulation and applying styles dynamically.

## Instructions to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azit-rana0/dom_basic

   ```


2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
   cd ./

   ```


3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the project.

4. The JavaScript file (script.js) will automatically manipulate the target div element when the webpage is loaded.
